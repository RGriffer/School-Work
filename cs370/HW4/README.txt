1. Is the Shortest Remaining Time First a non-preemptive Algorithm?

    No, it is a preemptive algorithm

2. What are the 5 different states a process can be in scheduling (Look into process state
diagram)?

    new, ready, running, Waiting, terminated

3. Shortest Job First is like Priority Scheduling with the priority based on ______ of the process?

    Remaining burst time

4. ________ effect is the primary disadvantage of First Come First Serve Scheduling algorithm.

    Convoy effect(small processes stuck behind large processes)

5. How does Multi Level Feedback queue prevent starvation of processes that waits too long in
lower priority queue?

    Processes that use too much CPU time are moved to the back of the queue, while a
    process that waits too long in a lower priority queue may be moved to a higher priority queue
