iterate through freq dictionary
turn each entry into priority tuple (PriorityTuple((freqVal, character))
collect all priority tuples into a list, then heapify that list

heappop off the heap (2 smallest) create new priority tuple of sum of freq, will look like -> (1,'h') (1,'o') -> (2,('h','o')) 
ASK ABOUT THIS AND WHY FORMATTING IS OFF, SYNTAX ISSUE?
ALSO ORDERING OFF?

push this new merged priority tuple back onto the heap

go all the way through till (totalCharInLine, (shit ton of nested tuples))

take only shit ton of nested tuples and set it as root

create new dictionary for created codes

create a new function to traverse the tree. (take node, prefix) as the parameters
    base case if node is leaf
    add the code generated to the codes dictionary
    
    else recurse
    travel the node to the left, add 0 to the prefix
    travel the node to the right, add 1 to the prefix
